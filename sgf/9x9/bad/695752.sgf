LinuxGooo: it could have been an interesting move for black to attack quickly into whites area
LinuxGooo: but lets have a look what you could have played
LinuxGooo: black even could have attacked side
LinuxGooo: 9x9 is gambling around with variations.... its just a training tool for playing the big board :-)
scialen: at say... B5?

scialen: I got intimidated by that
LinuxGooo: you have an idea why white  didd F6
scialen: to invade?
LinuxGooo: white is behind, as black has first move... which is round about 10 points behind... so on such a small board like 9x9 it needs a quick and very aggressive playing of white to compensate this difference
LinuxGooo: one stone is round about 10 points value, is said in GO
scialen: D:
scialen: so you had to try and cut me down quick?
LinuxGooo: so you always should do a move, which gives you the chance for 10 points
scialen: and what made your move a good move?
LinuxGooo: yes, its just 81 coordinates and not 381 which gives more time, so the fuseki opening for white here is very short
LinuxGooo: I pushed you into gote, and kept sente to control centre
scialen: hmm... that makes a lot of sense - it is like a move played on many levels
scialen: not just for territory, not just attack, but psychology as well
LinuxGooo: yes, this move has multifunctions, as it even can cover the top side
scialen: okay
LinuxGooo: as Go is a "tradiing, you could have said, OK, I give up one corner, maybe

LinuxGooo: by time your mind will become more flexible to get ideas what might be played
LinuxGooo: a beginner has no ideas, what all is possible with these simple stones and simple rules
scialen: yeah
LinuxGooo: sometimes its just mind blowing
scialen: and every move you make challenges me
scialen: like I go blank and go 'what do I do here?'

scialen: all from 1
LinuxGooo: the lowest win for white, less this in bottom left corner
LinuxGooo: yes, thats why Dan pre-tthink up to 20 moves
scialen: okay
scialen: and there's no easy way to learn it is there - yuou just have to play the games
LinuxGooo: a stone can has tremendous effect 10,20 or 40 moves later
LinuxGooo: not only games, you have to do lots of exercises on the board... more time you spend with analysing game and moves
LinuxGooo: because only learning by loosing game is very boring
scialen: and how do you analyse games for yourself? Like we're doing here?
LinuxGooo: yes, excatly... again and again you go through all variations for No. 1 to understand what is possible, and try to remember it for games later :-)
scialen: as I'm starting out, is it bad to get others to go through variations with me?
scialen: because I wouldn't know what to think on these
LinuxGooo: thats why its a normal way, that you play a game, then you see... someething went wrong, and ask for higher players tto do short reviews... not the whole game, but sequences to understna what you might have done betterin that situatoin...
LinuxGooo: experienced players of 1D-3kyu or so know the answers quickly
