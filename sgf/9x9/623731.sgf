C[freehold: why do you want an undo?
]
C[ba-yu: no. I didn't ask for one.
]
C[ba-yu: Maybe it is some bug. Or I accidently clicked twice when submitting.
]
C[ba-yu: I never ever ask for undos.
]
C[ba-yu: I'm sorry for the confusion. A3 is the move I wanted to play.
]
C[ba-yu: Please dismiss my undo-request.

C[ba-yu: it was probably an instance of this: http://forums.online-go.com/t/location-of-undo-button/696/8

C[ba-yu: It's now 11 days since the reply of the mod that they are gonna change something..
