C[Mr Newby: Hmmm
]
C[Mr Newby: Well thanks for the #1 spot, completely undeserved.  I think I have a moral obligation to give it back to you.
]
C[pollemand: w +1.5
]
C[pathogenix: ...
]
C[pathogenix: Oh... negative komi
]
C[crodgers: yeah...
]
C[crodgers: is that correct?
]
C[crodgers: if negative komi is correct, then the score is correct
]
C[pathogenix: yeah, if the game was intended to be even, then it's wrong.
]
C[crodgers: but ladder games are even, right?
]
C[pathogenix: But the score is correct with negative komi
]
C[crodgers: yeah, but i think komi should be 6.5
]
C[pathogenix: I think it's supposed to be 5.5 I wonder if it got broken when anoek was fixing the auto-handicap stuff
]
C[ST000MA: Does it mean that handicap on 9x9 is now only changing komi?
