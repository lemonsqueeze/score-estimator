C[illluck: Mmm, I wonder if J4 and then F2 work here?
]
C[Traxtin: interesting but you would still have to connect underneath so that would just be as if you had played the same variation but added a move at J4 at the end.  The best move here would probably be H1 then if i descend at G1 you can play j4 and then i only have 1 eye and you could probably kill me with f2 then... so if you descended i would just play at J5 and connect under letting you kill the one stone at G2 :)

C[illluck: Ah, I see... I did not realize that there is an eye at J1...
