C[Noobrunswick: Valuable lesson : rectangular six in the corner is dead
]
;B[af]
C[Lighten: yeah, I know.  But I can't get more space :)
]
C[Noobrunswick: But you did it twice in one tiny board game
]
C[Noobrunswick: That might be a worlds record :)
]
C[Lighten: Yep.  I hadn't played 9x9 seriously in years.  Discovered there's a lot less space to work with.

;W[ag]
C[Noobrunswick: I've never played it seriously. I didn't notice the board size when I answered your open challenge

C[Lighten: right, by seriously I meant "when I was learning".  But I caught one randomly lately, and found out I die :)

C[Lighten: so I figure I may as well play them until I figure out how to get the smaller fights to work.
