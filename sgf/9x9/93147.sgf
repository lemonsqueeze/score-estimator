C[KyuT: I think you had a very good opening, this at F7 seems hard for white
]
C[topazg: For some strange reason I hadn't considered wF7 properly, and didn't want to play bF7 because I read wG7 bF8 wF6 as bad?
]
C[KyuT: Then I think it must go bE7 wG8 then I think black can play G9 in sente (because of aji of F4/F5) then switch to G1, allowing white to capture at E5 and win the ko at H2 but black still has more points. It's complicated though. But basically I think the corner is worth more than the two stones F4/F5 potential gote capture.

C[KyuT: I'm pretty sure G1 is better in this case. I think you win that way.
]
C[topazg: No idea why I chose this. I think I felt G1 was gote and this was sente, but the game showed they were both gote :p

C[topazg: And I'd read that this was sente because of wF9 bD9 w(tenuki) bH7 - very silly misread, but still w 0.5 so didn't make much difference in the end ;)
