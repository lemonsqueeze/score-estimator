C[Noobrunswick: hmm- my bored doesn't show numbers
]
C[Noobrunswick: board*
]
C[Noobrunswick: even though it is checked on the left side
]
C[mark5000: weird.
]
C[mark5000: happy framework. From move 94: F7 
]
C[Noobrunswick: yeah, i assumed you would play there
]
C[mark5000: I think it's still okay. Who knows.
]
C[Noobrunswick: i'm looking for a tesuji that probably doesn't exist :)
]
C[mark5000: Feel free. I've got to run right now. Finish later.

]
C[Noobrunswick: but maybe not
]
;W[iq]
C[Noobrunswick: i didn't want to try and live in the middle
]
C[mark5000: You're right. It's favorable for me, but I can't be certain. I've heard you should play simply when ahead.
]
;B[mo]
C[Noobrunswick: he question is, are you still ahead?
]
C[Noobrunswick: i haven't counted
]
;W[jo]
C[mark5000: I think so. You've put some unexpected dents in, to be sure.

C[mark5000: Thanks for the game
]
C[Noobrunswick: well done
]
C[Noobrunswick: fun game
]
C[Noobrunswick: even though my opening was terrible
]
C[mark5000: I'm going through a big frameworks phase.
]
C[Noobrunswick: i'm going through a crappy fuseki phase
]
C[Noobrunswick: it
]
C[mark5000: What happened in the opening?
]
C[Noobrunswick: it's lasted about 30 years
]
C[mark5000: I mean, it seemed okay, at least initially.
]
C[Noobrunswick: you built a wall along the whole side of the board
]
C[Noobrunswick: then you lived with your little groups too spaciously
]
C[Noobrunswick: 19 points in the little corners
]
C[mark5000: Yeah. It was good until the top left developed.
]
C[mark5000: I think.
]
C[Noobrunswick: problem with the ko at E16 is if you win you've got a huge move at D17
]
C[Noobrunswick: Well, you knocked me down to 6 kyu -- so next time I'll get three stones. That ought to be worth 7.5 points! :)
]
C[Noobrunswick: anyway. thanks - fun game
]
C[mark5000: Definitely! Thanks for the game
