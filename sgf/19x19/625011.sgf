C[Nogravity: Hello again my friend ... have a nice game :)
]
C[Nogravity: i dont like possibility of planing conditional moves. It makes me hard time resisting cheating
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Good morning :) I wish you the same! Not very familiar with the UI yet. I'm not sure how conditional moves works, but it's when you play out a specific sequence if  the opponents moves accordingly?
]
C[fredrikkoehler: I saw the button now, "plan conditional moves".. :) 
]
C[Nogravity: Yes, it allows to plan as many possible variants as you want but can be used as cheating while one dont want to read so deep :) ... anyway, good game to you, and have fun :)
]
;B[pd]
C[fredrikkoehler: Ah, I see. I should disable it in my forthcoming games.. and refrain from using it now as well :)

C[Nogravity: Hello again :) ... your playstyle looks nice, solid frameworks, stable constructions. I cant see a way to make something happen. .... or maybe, we will see soon :). Realy excited ...

C[Nogravity: i am sorry for my bad english expressions ...

C[fredrikkoehler: Thanks :) I'm trying to "get into" go again. Not been very active for a while. I really like OGS so far, lots of friendly people :)

C[fredrikkoehler: I played on kgs some years ago, but recently I've played mostly correnspondence game on DGS. What about you?

C[Nogravity: I have found OGS more friendly too :)

C[fredrikkoehler: Hmm, it feels like the forthcoming moves could be quite game defining
]
C[Nogravity: i do not ... it seems that most of board is not decided yet ... :)
]
C[Nogravity: any other GO server you are playing at ?
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Maybe you are right :) I feel I would like to improve my direction of play-sense
]
C[fredrikkoehler: occasionally I play at DGS, http://www.dragongoserver.net/ as Sinkadus. But I feel that OGS will become my primary go site as it has both correnspondence and  shorter game opportunities
]
C[Nogravity: one thing i would recomend you to do in future, but i will tell you after game is played. If you would like :)
]
C[Nogravity: i started on IGS server, pandanet look so nice, but people there are so aggressive, and i learned only to play so fast. That is first thing i have to unlearn
]
C[fredrikkoehler: absolutely, would appreciate some comments after the game! I think I have played too much without analyse or feedback sessions afterwards. I'm sure it's the source for not improving very much for a long time. Would like to play IRL more as well

C[fredrikkoehler: mm, I think you would gotten a good lead even if i Sacrificed qr14 (even though it was a big mistake from my side) 
]
C[fredrikkoehler: more than one vulnerability up there  I think
]

;B[eh]
C[fredrikkoehler: lunch for me now, later :)
]
C[Nogravity: later :)
]
C[Nogravity: have a good one :)
]
C[Nogravity: in the meanwhile i would like to comment something ... Q16 group changes score a lot, but still white would lead by about 15 pts without it ... critical moment i see i letting white build a big territorry while rescuing his own big dragon. â€¦ I think, that you shouldnt have played so many moves to secure E16 group. This Exchange was even, but gave white a tempo. Another not easy joseki started by R3 stone. I am not sure what is the best solution by black, but in this situation black got weak stone and left white secured (or easy to live) 
]
C[Nogravity: sorry if my comments look like i am cocky, but i see you play wonderful moves and this little mistakes made it harder for you ...
]
C[fredrikkoehler: no worries, I'm happy to getting feedback :) Well yeah, the lower joseki was perhaps a bit complicated  and with an unsure outcome. maybe i should have played simpler and more "loose"?

C[Nogravity: if you would like, we can play more games simultaneously, which will be unrated to sharpen your style ... but my style is based on complicated situations and trying to turn them on my side. So if you wouldnt mind, and if you would like, it can be nice :) ...  
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Nice, that would be a great learning experience I think.
]
;W[lq]
;B[jl]
C[fredrikkoehler: What is your occupation by the way? Student, working or something else?
]
;W[ik]
;B[la]
C[Nogravity: i am working :) ... but not for so long :) what about you ?
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Soon to be student? I've been working for a bit more than 3 years, before that I studied at the university
]
C[Nogravity: nice ... what was or is your specialty? ... i am working for a while, 6 years now. Studied Civil engineering on high school and once tried university, but i had no morale :) ...
]
C[Nogravity: so it seems that we are about the same age :) ... when you started playing GO ?
]
;W[pa]
;B[ic]
C[fredrikkoehler: Well, I learned the rules quite a while ago actually. during my military service, back in the days when it was mandatory here in sweden. 11 years ago or so. But I haven't been active all the time during that 11 year stretch, even though I have been "plateauing" around this rank for  a couple of years now
]
C[fredrikkoehler: I studied cognitive science, and have been working as an application consultant for an HR company until two day ago, when I became some sort of system analyst instead
]
C[fredrikkoehler: 29 years young ;)
]
;W[ma]
C[Nogravity: wow, here in Czech Republic was mandatory military service cancelled about five years before i grew to the right age, so my physical and mental stability werent sharped by this. Today we say hopefully. So it seems that compared with your life experiences i am quite a rookie :) ... Age 25 now, :) 
]
;B[ni]
C[Nogravity: You mean, that you quit your previouse job in one company to start working as system analyst in another, or it is in the same company ?
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Didn't know what I would think of being drafted beforehand, but I met one of my closest go buddies that also taught me the game there :) One thing that you got good at was doing your chores exactly on time.. if you finished early you got another tedious chore. So, alas a bunch of lazy ass swedish recruits ;)
]
C[fredrikkoehler: it's the same company, but another product. It's really nice to have connections within the company and still getting to learn a lot of new stuff
]
C[Nogravity: ... in the meanwhile. I have my near future linked like this: My girlfriend will leave me when she finishes her university degree (any kind), and after this i will have plenty of time to pack my stuff and travel to another country i will find cool in that moment :) .... and still GO will be game number one for me :P
]
C[Nogravity: :D
]
C[Nogravity: yes it seems right ... if company you work for finds you very useful and you are not only one of many, it is very nice. ... What company are you working for ?
]
C[Nogravity: if its not secret :) ... remember, anyone can see this conversation :)
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Ah, leaving as leaving the relationship? Doesn't sound like a nice person in that case. Well I really would like to travel more. Travelling like a go vagabond could be nice, there's a go club in almost every larger city I should wager :)
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Aditro is the name of the company. Mostly oriented to the nordic countries but have offices in Estonia as well
]
C[Nogravity: All my friends and people i know tell me that girl will leave you after she get her university degree. So i need to be prepared for the worst scenario :) 'or best scenario, 
]
;W[js]
;B[af]
;W[di]
C[Nogravity: Traveling like a vagabond seems nice, but what i ment was leaving country i live in now for a while. Havent been anywhere else in my whole life 
]
C[Nogravity: again and again. I am sorry for my bad English ... havent used it for a long time
]
;B[sg]
C[Nogravity: One thing i admire most on living in another country, in this case specially Sweden, is, that you havent so many thieves and criminals like we do. (rumors or true, cant say :) )
]
C[fredrikkoehler: Well, It's hard to know, there might be less socioeconomic divsion here compared to a lot of other countries. but there are segregation and violence and such things here as well (Stockholm) that you can see in most cities around europe
]
C[fredrikkoehler: I'm not sure how it's to live in Berlin, but i really fell in love with that city. There are quite a lot of regulations and stuff here that are less a pain in som other countries in europe
]
;W[sf]
C[fredrikkoehler: Would like to visit Prague again, visited there when I  was 13 or 14. Drank my first pils :)
]
C[Nogravity: :) ... I dont like Prague, it doesnt corespondent with the rest of the Czech Republic. City made by tourists for tourists :)
]
;B[na]
C[Nogravity: I would love to vitis Sweden sometime ... But in our country you are either poor or mega rich person, nothing between :),  and it is hard for pepople to save any money for traveling ...  
]
C[fredrikkoehler: would be nice to start up two new game at least after this one :)
