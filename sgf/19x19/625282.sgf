C[oiseaux: mostly chopping up samples, timestretching them, playing them at slow speeds, then recording back and forth onto tapes for extra murkiness. apply reverb, delay lines and other effects to taste

C[oiseaux: most of this record was live using a boss loop station, guitar amps and pedals with post-processing in Cubase

C[oiseaux: i stumbled across a curious book on my spree
]
C[oiseaux: let me find it
]
;B[pe]
C[oiseaux: "Go Nation: Chinese Masculinities and the Game of Weiqi in China"
]
C[oiseaux: Looks v. interesting
]
;W[hc]
C[oiseaux: As Chinese politics have changed over the last two millennia, so too has the imagery of the game. In Imperial times it was seen as a tool to seek religious enlightenment and was one of the four noble arts that were a requisite to becoming a cultured gentleman. During the Cultural Revolution it was a stigmatized emblem of the lasting effects of feudalism. Today, it marks the reemergence of cultured gentlemen as an idealized model of manhood. Marc L. Moskowitz explores the fascinating history of the game, as well as providing a vivid snapshot of Chinese Go players today. Go Nation uses this game to come to a better understanding of Chinese masculinity, nationalism, and class, as the PRC reconfigures its history and traditions to meet the future.
]
C[paintcan: ahh, i don't get any that go that deeply into cultural context
]
C[paintcan: for me, there must always be at least a few games or problems or pleasant snippets to accompany the text
]
C[oiseaux: yeah that's more on the anthropology / history side of things
